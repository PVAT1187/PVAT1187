# Highlighted Projects
- Drowsiness Detection App (Android Application)
    - A real-time Android application designed to monitor driver drowsiness by analyzing facial features
      such as eye movements uising Google ML Kit. Integrated with Firebase and BigQuery for analytics,
      data storage and visualization.
      
- Mini Games Collection	(C++ Console Application)
    - A simple command-line Mini Games Collection built in C++ using Visual Studio.
      This project demonstrates object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, along with
      shared game logic, and modular project design through two classic games: Tic Tac Toe and Rock Paper Scissors.
      
- Todo List Application (C++ Console Application)
    - A simple command-line Todo List application built in C++ using Visual Studio.
      This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and modular project design.
      
- Trick or Treat Route Project (Hackathon)
    - 48-hour hackathon project that visualizes safe trick-or-treat routes using Leaflet for map rendering
      and Google Maps API for calculating and displaying routes between trick-or-treat locations
